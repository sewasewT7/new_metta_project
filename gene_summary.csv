ENSG00000128245,"Here is a summary of the gene data in 2 sentences:

The gene ENSG00000128245, also known as YWHAH, is located on chromosome 22 and encodes a protein called 14-3-3 eta, which is a regulatory protein involved in the activation of enzymes that require tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activity. This gene is also referred to as YWHA1, which is one of several genes in the 14-3-3 family of proteins that play roles in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses."
ENSG00000175793,"Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene data:

The human gene ENSG00000175793 encodes a protein called SFN, also known as 14-3-3 protein sigma or epithelial cell marker protein 1. SFN is a stratifin protein, which is a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins that play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and regulation, and is located on chromosome 1 at position 26,863,149-26,864,456."
ENSG00000170027,"Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene data:

The gene ENSG00000170027 is located on human chromosome 7 and encodes for the protein 14-3-3 protein gamma, also known as YWHAG, which is a protein kinase inhibitor that regulates the activity of protein phosphatase 1. This gene is also associated with tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein gamma (PPP1R170) and has several aliases, including KCIP-1 and DEE56."
ENSG00000134308,"Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene data:

The gene ENSG00000134308 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 2 and spans from base pair 9583967 to 9630997. The gene encodes for a protein called 14-3-3_theta, also known as YWHAQ, which is involved in various cellular processes including tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein activity."
ENSG00000108953,"Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene information:

The YWHAE gene (ENS G00000108953) encodes a protein called 14-3-3 epsilon, also known as tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, epsilon (TCM10), which is involved in various cellular processes including protein kinase regulation and mitochondrial import. This gene is located on chromosome 17 and its protein product, YWHAE, plays roles in human diseases such as mental health disorders and cell proliferation regulation, and has also been annotated as a mitochondrial import stimulation factor and epididymis luminal protein 2 (ELP2)."
ENSG00000166913,"Here is a summary of the gene data:

The ENSG00000166913 gene, located on chromosome 20, encodes the protein 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha, also known as YWHA-B, with synonyms such as tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, beta polypeptide and protein kinase C inhibitor protein-1. This gene is also associated with other aliases, including protein 1054, KCIP-1, GW128, HS1, and HEL-S-1."
