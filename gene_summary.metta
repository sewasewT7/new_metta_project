(gene_summary (gene ENSG00000170027) "Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene data:

The gene ENSG00000170027 is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 7 (chr7) at position 76,326,799-76,358,991 and has multiple aliases, including YWHAG, PPP1R170, EIEE56, KCIP-1, and 14-3-3 gamma. This gene encodes a protein known as 14-3-3 protein gamma or protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1, which plays a regulatory role in signaling pathways and interacts with various other proteins, including protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 170.")
(gene_summary (gene ENSG00000108953) "Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene information:

The gene ENSG00000108953 is the human gene that encodes the protein YWHAE (14-3-3 epsilon), which is involved in various cellular processes, including kinase regulation, tyrosine/tryptophan activation, and mitochondrial import. The YWHAE protein, also known as 14-3-3 epsilon, is associated with several functional roles, including tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation, and its dysfunction has been linked to diseases such as mental retardation, deafness, and dysmorphism, among others.")
(gene_summary (gene ENSG00000166913) "Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene information:

The ENSG00000166913 gene, located on chromosome 20, encodes for the YWHAB protein, which is also known as tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, beta polypeptide, and plays a role in inhibiting protein kinase C activity. Additionally, this gene is also referred to as 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha and has several other aliases, including protein 1054, KCIP-1, HEL-S-1, and GW128.")
(gene_summary (gene ENSG00000128245) "Here is a summary of the gene data in 2 sentences:

The gene ENSG00000128245 encodes for the YWHAH protein, which is a 14-3-3 eta protein that plays a role in the regulation of cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and PP2A anchoring and activation. This gene is located on chromosome 22 and spans from base pair 31944522 to 31957603.")
(gene_summary (gene ENSG00000175793) "Here is a 2-sentence summary of the gene data:

The gene ENSG00000175793 encodes the protein SFN, also known as stratifin or 14-3-3 protein sigma, which is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 1. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and survival, and is commonly used as a marker for epithelial cells.")
(gene_summary (gene ENSG00000134308) "Based on the provided gene data (ENSG00000134308), the gene in question is a protein-coding gene named YWHAQ, also known as 14-3-3 protein tau, which is involved in various cellular processes. The gene is located on chromosome 2 (chr2) at positions 9583967 to 9630997 and is classified as a tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, theta, with several alternative names, including 14-3-3 protein, theta, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, theta polypeptide, and 14-3-3 protein, T-cell.")
